Hello this is a simple program to automate the hussle of finding your course file / material on your downloads folder <br/>

For all the non VITians out there <br/>
  At this institute our faculty uploads our study materials on our website VTOP and when we download it it comes with wierd names such as
  'FALLSEM2019-20_PHY1701_ETH_VL2019201005735_Reference_Material_I_09-Sep-2019_DYE_Laser___Excimer_Laser' So your Downloads would look <br/>	      like 
	![](images/Screenshot%20(36).png)
   So each file would have a different name <br/>
   each name signifies something  such as:<br/>
   	'FALLSEM2019-20_     PHY1701       _ETH_VL2019201005735_Reference_Material_I_09-Sep-2019_  DYE_Laser___Excimer_Laser'<br/>
	    -SEM-         -subject code-        -class_number material number and date-              -Name of the content<br/>
    So we student what do we want , we want our materials to be on different folders according to subject and just the Name of the content <br/>
    So, I have created a python script and converted to a .exe file , Now when we paste the file to the location of all downloaded files and run it the folder woud look somewhat like this

    So here i had only Maths and Physics materials downloaded so it created the required folders and pasted the files in the respective folders after renaming them to the Name of the content<br/>
